# On Tap Roblox Painting

This project uses **BaseX** and **LuaLZW** — big thanks to their developers for providing these libraries!  

## Usage

1. Type the path of the image you want to convert in `painting.js`.  
2. Run `painting.js`.  
3. Enjoy the output in `output.txt`.  

## Absolute Small Details Explanation
1. Make sure you have everything required installed. Such as, node.js and luajit.
2. Download the repository's zip and extract it.
3. Put any image in the same folder.
4. Edit `painting.js` line `7` to the image file name including extension **OR** rename the image to `image.png`
5. Open a CMD in that folder and run `npm i`. (Only for the first time running the code. You can skip this if you've done it before)
6. Run `node painting.js` in that same CMD.
7. Enjoy your code in a new file called `output.txt`
